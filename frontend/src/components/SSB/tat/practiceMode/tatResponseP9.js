      "Rasika was a young girl living in Kutchi village in Maharashtra, she would travel every day for 2 km to collect water for their daily work and the same was the situation for all the village women, and she had observed that many women had started having problems due to carrying such heavy water pots for long distances, Rasika decided to fix this problem. She thought that installing handpumps, and educating villagers about efficient water management as well as collecting and storing the rainwater would prove a better alternative and would also prevent the women from hectic work, she decided to discuss this concern with the sarpanch. She did so and the sarpanch liked her idea, he immediately took up a plan to install hand pumps, and as the rainy season was around the corner he also dug long and big trenches to collect water, Rasika also requested a meeting to be organized with all the villagers so that she could explain them about water management and rainwater harvesting at the individual level, Rasika studied on the Internet about various rainwater harvesting processes & got to know the details, in the meeting she explained all the methods to the villagers and over the time when the things were put into practice the village started to see significant changes right from the water availability to the efficient use of water.",

      "Balbir had been saving to renovate his old house for quite some time. It needed repair, some rebuilding, and paint. He went to market, brought brochures from the hardware store, and discussed colors with his family. He then called the painter who had painted his house earlier and told him about all that was needed to be done. The painter gave a rough estimate of the cost and material needed. He also hired a contractor for doing the rebuilding part. He went to the store and bought the necessary material. While he was in office, he asked his son to ensure that work is being done up to the mark. On holidays, he oversaw all the work and made sure to bring whatever extra material was required. He and his wife offered tea and biscuits to the workers during breaks and prepared lunch on weekends for them as well. After a couple of months, the job was completed. He paid the contractor and thanked him for the great work he and his men did. He and his family were satisfied with the work and happy as it felt like a new house",

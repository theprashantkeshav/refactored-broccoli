      "Sonali was a final year BA student living in a small village of Haryana. The majority of the population in her village depended on agriculture for livelihood. One day while Sonali was returning from her college, she saw her neighbor standing sadly staring at her husband who was working in the field. Upon asking Sonali learned that her neighbor was five-month pregnant, so she could no longer work in the field with her husband, which she was afraid will lead to a shortage of manpower which will affect the yield of crops. After assessing the situation Sonali comforted her and assured her that she would provide whatever help she could. From the very next day, Sonali started working in her neighbor’s field after college hours. In due process, she learned a lot about farming and its techniques. She narrated her experience with her classmates and they were intrigued. Her friends too started helping her and learned many important aspects of farming. Her neighbor was very thankful to Sonali and her friends for their selfless Effort. ",

      "Ganga was a milkmaid working at a dairy. She used to deliver milk to the residents of many apartments in the city. She used to keep the milk container outside the door and took empty containers of the previous delivery. One day she could not find the empty container outside one of the houses. She knocked at the door many times but no one responded, but she knew that at this time of the day the owner of the house which happens to be an old lady is always present. So out of suspicion she took the extra key from the guard and opened the door and to her surprise, she found the old lady fallen unconscious in the hallway. Without wasting any time Ganga informed the guard about the situation and took her to the nearest hospital in a taxi. Later the doctor told her that the old lady had a minor heart attack but she is out of danger now. The doctor also applauded her for the good use of intelligence and not waiting for an Ambulance as the situation was critical.",

      "Aman along with his family lived in a remote village of Uttar Pradesh. He was pursuing his higher-secondary Education from the government school. One day Aman came home from school and found his father had a severe stomach ache. There was no doctor or hospital in his village so they had to rush to the city which was very far from the village. The later doctor told Aman that his father has kidney stones but will be fine after performing minor surgery. Aman was relieved to hear that but was dejected at the same time regarding the lack of health facilities in his village. He had seen many of his fellow villagers suffer due to a lack of medical services. Aman raised this issue in the next panchayat meeting and told everyone to take a hard stance for the medical facilities of his village. Later the panchayat approached the government and was able to build a primary health care facility in his village. Aman also studied hard and became a doctor who served needy people throughout his service in the remote area of the country. ",

      "Gaurav was an electrical engineer working in a distribution company in Banglore. Once he visited his native village and noticed that no households had a proper supply of electricity. The distribution companies were not ready to invest as the number of connections that would be demanded was very less. Moreover, the village was located far off from the generating station, hence they could not make a profit. So Gaurav decided to solve this problem using a free-falling waterfall situated near the village. With the help of a few NGOs, he managed to set up a water turbine and generating setup connected with the wiring of a few kilometers. Now villagers could get an electric supply for optimum consumption. Gaurav also approached the government authority to come up with a permanent solution for the village. Villagers thanked Gaurav for his meticulous approach to solving this problem. ",

      "Vikram was a cloth merchant living in a small village of Madhya Pradesh. Most of the villagers used to go to the nearby town to conduct their business. Since the main road to the town was very long, they used to take a shortcut through a jungle and then cross a river where the boat service was available. During a rainy season, the river current was so strong that they could no longer cross it. Hence everyone had to take the main road to the town which was very time-consuming. Looking at the situation Vikram approached the panchayat and presented a proposal of building a bridge across the river. The panchayat members were influenced by Vikram's proposal and approached the government authority for this. In a few weeks, a bridge was constructed across the river and villagers were easily able to cross it. Vikram felt happy for uniting the villagers and getting the work done. He also hired the oarsman of the boat in his cloth shop as he had lost his livelihood. ",

      "Harish was an attendee in a government school. Apart from looking after the campus, he also used to look after the well-being of the students. In the summer season, he observed many students collapsing during morning assembly due to giddiness. Harish used to carry the collapsed students to the restroom and look after them until they were ready to go to their respective classes. Harish felt that students of that age need to be strong. He knew that a better diet and lifestyle could increase their general health and stamina. He approached the principal of the school and suggested him to include cereals and pulses in the mid-day meal and encourage students to take physical education and outdoor sports. As a result of this, students developed healthy bodies and good stamina, and the collapsing cases reduced. Harrish was applauded for his caring nature and selfless effort. ",

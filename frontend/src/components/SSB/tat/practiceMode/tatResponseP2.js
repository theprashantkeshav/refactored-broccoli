      "Sheela was working in her field in Satpura district. Due to close proximity to Satpura Tiger Reserve, there had been numerous incidents of Tigers wandering into agricultural fields. Due to this, the villagers had conducted training many times with forest officials on how to survive tiger attacks. While working she noticed some movement, upon enquiring with caution she saw the tiger. She maintained her calm, made herself look big, and screamed at the top of her voice to scare the tiger away and drew the attention of others working with her. The tiger still came towards her and pounced. Without any delay, she attacked it with a sickle and injured it badly. Upon seeing a lot of people, the tiger got scared and ran away. She was then carried towards the village clinic and treated for injuries. She thanked the people who came and saved her life. She felt very lucky to survive a tiger attack which made her more cautious while working in fields.  ",

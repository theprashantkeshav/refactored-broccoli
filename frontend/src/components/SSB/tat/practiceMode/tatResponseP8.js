Savita understood the concern and calmed everyone down, she first requested the truck driver to move his vehicle aside and to let other vehicles pass by and told them that their arguing on the streets is causing a hindrance to everyone she requested the truck driver to give drive responsibly and give passing space to other as well since others might be in any kind of urgency and that he should not be speeding on the busy Street as it might lead to an accident which will cause damage and a problem to himself as well, she also asked the other people to not quarrel in the middle of the streets instead they could have peacefully made him understand.

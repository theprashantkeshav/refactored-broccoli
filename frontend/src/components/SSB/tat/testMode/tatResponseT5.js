      "While visiting his old village house, Gaurav and his father were cleaning their old closet when Gaurav found out his father’s old Tanpura. He was fascinated by looking at such an old instrument which was preserved by his father in pristine condition. He wondered how it was played and asked his father if we could take it back with them. He brought it with him and sat with his father while he played and taught him basic lessons. He learned how to sit properly and strum his fingers to achieve the notes and chords in the Tanpura. He watched YouTube videos to improve his style and practiced with his father after coming from school. He also took help from his music teacher at school. Whenever he took a break from studies, he practiced on the tanpura and then went to play volleyball in the evening. After about 4 months, he was able to play it decently. He also got his name registered in the music week of his school and played the tanpura there which he and everyone enjoyed. He was happy to learn and appreciated Indian music culture.  ",

      "Gurlal was a Deputy Commandant in BSF and was posted in Rajasthan along the Pakistan border. He was informed of incidents of the crossing border by Pakistanis into India. Since there were a lot of villages nearby the borders, the villagers often had prior information about the border activities. Gurlal saw this as an opportunity and with permission from his seniors, he formed a team of his men and went to the Sarpanch of the villages and told them about the proposal that whosoever will give credible intel on cross border activities, will get monetary rewards. Many people came forward and became informers for the BSF. This helped the BSF in curbing infiltrations and illegal border crossing. Every time a culprit was caught sneaking in from the border, the respective person who gave intel was rewarded and thanked by the BSF.  ",

      "Yogesh was a businessman based in Delhi; he was going to attend an important meeting in Mumbai. He was provided with the plane tickets. He held a final meeting with his team to discuss the proposal and finalized the presentation. He packed the essentials and headed to the airport, checked in his baggage, and boarded the plane. The fellow passenger who was sitting beside him was a first-time flyer. He was anxious and a bit scared for his first flight. Yogesh initiated a conversation, got to know that he was scared. He comforted him and ensured that it was nothing to worry about since air travel is the safest of all statistically. Rather than further talking about planes, he changed the topic to food, which usually everyone loves and they talked at lengths about Mumbai and Delhi’s local food and which was better. He also suggested places to visit in Mumbai. The flight landed, Yogesh bid goodbye and headed to his destination. ",

      "Satpal was a policeman in the local thana. While he was not on regular day patrol, he noticed that the pedestrians were forced to walk on the road as shopkeepers had encroached the footpath and carried out their activities on it. He signaled his driver to stop and approached a car mechanic who was working on a mini-truck and had occupied a major portion of the footpath. He asked him to get the shop owner and issued a fine against him and warned if it happened again, he would have to pay a heftier fine. Satpal then went to the police station and informed SHO about it, for which the SHO issued an order for the shopkeeper union to remove their stuff from footpaths, otherwise, they would be fined. Satpal did regular patrols during his duty time to ensure that pedestrians were using footpaths without any problems. ",

      "Karan was working in a software company and owned a motorcycle. He had always dreamt of buying his car for which he had been saving since the day he started earning. He had created a separate fixed deposit to buy the car. Before buying he consulted his father about whether to buy a new car or second hand, his father advised him to buy a second-hand car as it would be cheaper and he would easily drive without worrying about getting scratches. He talked to his friends and got to know about a local dealer who dealt with pre-owned cars. He went with his father and friend to the dealer and quoted his requirement. His friend checked for technicalities and they test drove the car which Karan liked. Finally, they negotiated the price and gave an advance for booking, and financed the rest of the amount via bank. He went home and showed his mother the car. He distributed sweets among neighbors and was very happy to buy his first car.  ",

      "Seeta was married to a man who had a strong addiction to alcohol. At times, after coming home drunk, he would often misbehave with her. To resolve this, Seeta first talked to her inlaws about her husband’s addiction since they were all concerned about his health and safety. They talked to him and decided to take professional help from a mental health professional. Seeta often accompanied him during his sessions as moral support. She was determined to resolve his problems and stood by him in the toughest of times. She was also supported by her in-laws to a great extent. She also created a positive environment at home and among both of them so that he would share his problems rather than resort to drinking. She also ensured that he didn’t take any form of intoxicants and took prescribed meds. After some time, both of them were happy with the progress, and soon enough, her husband had changed into a better man.  ",

Manraj and Marvik together composed lyrics and chorus parts while Avinash worked on the beats and guitar. After classes, they went to the auditorium and practiced their song. In about two weeks, they finalized the final draft and started practicing it more frequently. On the farewell day, during mid-show, they surprised everybody by carrying out their performance.

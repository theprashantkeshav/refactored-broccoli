      "Abhay was a doctor in a government hospital. He was once approached by a patient who told him that he had problems with his renal function, he referred a test to the laboratory for urine and KFT. When the reports were out the patient was diagnosed with urinary tract infection which is quite common but Dr. Abhay knew that most of the patients after taking initial doses when they feel good leave the medicines, so from now Dr. Abhay decided to educate his patients about the working of antibiotics. He said to his patient that the disease is caused by bacteria and bacteria can learn how to fight a medicine, which means if he leaves the medicine without completing the full dose the infection may return, and then the medicine may not even work, so despite if you feel good after taking few doses it is very important to complete the full dose. Dr. Abhay successfully convinced his patient to take the full dose of the antibiotics and be careful with antibiotics as they may go ineffective in case of misuse.",

      "Ramesh was the son of a farmer in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan. In his village observed that most of the young people were inclined more towards agriculture, he also observed that the agricultural productivity was not much in his region and also the number of people involved was more than required. This was one of the most important reasons why his region was backward. Ramesh talked to people about the problem of disguised unemployment, he was able to turn everyone’s focus on his point of view as his village had a low-category population, he motivated the women to take the benefit of StandUp India scheme which was exclusively for the women or lower castes so that they can set up an  MSME which can help them manufacture items like Pickles, Papads, Namkeens, etc. He convinced the people to participate in the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana to impart skills that can provide them with jobs. Multiple people joined the training centers under the PMKVY scheme. Now his village's source of earning was not solely dependent on agriculture. Ramesh was able to reduce dependency on agriculture in his village.",

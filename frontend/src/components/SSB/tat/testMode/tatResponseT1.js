      "Himang had recently completed his LLB and registered as an advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi. As he was more interested in corporate than litigation, he applied and gave interviews for different companies and got a job in a private firm. As a recruit, he had to be proficient in the nooks and corners of the company policy. He read it extensively and cleared his doubts from the senior legal advisor he worked under. He took his help in several matters and learned a lot from him. Although, Himang faced some difficulties initially and was under a little bit of stress given the large amount of work, he managed his time and work well, played volleyball after office hours to relieve stress. After a couple of months, he got familiar with everything around the office, made new friends, and enjoyed his work. He took out time to study for his masters and to learn new industry-related skills.",

      "Seeta’s daughter was good in academics but lacked in sports. Seeta being a state-level basketball player was very keen to see her daughter excel in a sport. She encouraged her and explained to her how sports help in holistic development and will benefit her in college admissions as well. Seeta talked to her husband, and during dinner, they asked their daughter which sport she liked the most. She liked all games but was particularly interested to learn swimming. As there was no pool in the school, Seeta searched nearby swimming academies and enrolled her daughter in one. After picking her daughter up from school, she took her to the academy where her daughter learned swimming in 2-3 weeks. She encouraged her daughter to take part in competitions and cheered for her during events. Her daughter now had the perfect balance in academics and games.",

      "Sohan used to go to the park in the evening for jogging. He would often see other runners practicing and after some days, passed a smile and exchanged greetings with fellow runners. After completing his run, he would enter the open gym area to do some target stretches and cool down. During the cooldown, he talked to fellow runners about run distance and timings. He asked them if he could join them to which they agreed. From the next day, they ran together which helped all of them as anyone who didn’t feel like running was motivated by the others and a sense of healthy competition was also promoted that improved their timings. Sohan also suggested that they take a day off and Sundays and go out to eat nearby, which they enjoyed. Sohan was happy to make new friends and became more consistent and improved his runs.",

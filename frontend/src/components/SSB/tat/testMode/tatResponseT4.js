      "Sucheta, 42, newly appointed scientist in the Pollution Control Board unit in Gurugram. In her first week, she visited the water bodies for inspection and found that industrial discharge, sewer leakage, biomagnification of pesticides have affected water quality. She discussed the issue with her team, took stratified samples, and tested the coliform count, PH, temperature, Oxygen level. She Compiled the data and made a presentation and briefed the department. She proposed the idea of installing a chlorine treatment system to reduce coliform count, adding calcium hydroxide to remove the hardness of the water. Everyone consented to Sucheta’s briefing and on behalf of the department she sent warning notices to the factories and carried out a water cleaning Plan. She with her team also organized an awareness campaign every weekend to focus on the root level.

Since the advisory had been issued two days earlier, he and other villagers had secured their important stuff on the higher floors. But the flash floods arrived one day earlier and a sudden evacuation was ordered. Amrit helped his family members and neighbors to get to higher points so that they could be evacuated easily and was later joined by his friends in the effort. While he was guiding some people, one of the young members of the family drifted apart, got panicked, and cried for help. Amrit immediately swam towards him and caught hold of him and asked him to hold on to his hand until they reach the high ground. He brought them and they were evacuated soon enough. Amrit and his friends helped the disaster response force in evacuating all people safely from the village",

      "Pratik was a young forest sub-inspector, he had set out for patrolling as a part of his daily schedule to keep a check on nearby villages as well as poaches. On reaching the village, he saw a ruckus outside one of the huts and people with sticks were surrounding the hut. He immediately rushed and found people panicking about a snake in the house, he calmed everyone and asked them to stay out of the house, he captured the snake with his instrument, and he then advised people to say calm as panicking disturbs the animals and provokes them to attack. He also taught them the difference between venomous and non-venomous snakes and requested to call for animal control or forest officials instead of killing the animal. He also made sure to keep visiting the village for regular surveillance and help villages as needed.",

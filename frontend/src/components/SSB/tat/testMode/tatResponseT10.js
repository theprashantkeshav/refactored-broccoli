One day in the newspaper he found an editorial mentioning Indian Institute of Horticulture Bangalore has developed high-yielding tomato seeds which are suitable for arid regions and the price of seeds was very less, the editorial also mentioned that the seeds can be ordered online. So Ajeet convinced his father and ordered the seeds. Within a few days, they received the order and planted it. The villagers were shocked to see the output. Rakesh and Ajeet helped others to order the same for them and also explored new developments.",

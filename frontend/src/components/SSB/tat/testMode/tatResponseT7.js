      "Mohanlal was a middle-aged person who worked in a government school as a teacher. One day while he was on an evening walk, he saw one of his students smoking a cigarette with a few adult boys. He found it a very delicate situation and thought of handling it with precaution. The next day he called the boy in his office and inquired about his action to which the boys got scared. Mohanlal politely made the boy understand that smoking at this age can cause severe health issues and destroy his career and that he is in the wrong company and should reconsider his group. The boy realized his mistake and apologized for his action and promised never to do it again. Mohanlal made sure that he quit smoking and introduced him to a few good students in his class so that he would get in good company.",

      "Arjun and his brother Rahul were in school and college respectively, they lived in the Sonpur village, over the time they observed that people of lower caste faced discrimination in their village, people used to give them separate glasses to drink water and used to avoid their touch, this made Arjun and his brother sensitize the villagers about the issue, they initially discussed it and made a plan that they will set examples by breaking this discriminatory social norm. They went to the Sarpanch of the village and presented him with the issue. The sarpanch was a well-educated person and understood the scenario and assured them of his help. They discussed the issue in the next panchayat meeting and spoke against the patriarchal system of discrimination and that it's not only immoral but illegal as well and goes against the fundamental rights of the constitution. They used the text of Manusmriti and Bhagwat Geeta to tell people that Caste depends upon Work and not birth. Gradually the mentality of the people started changing and their efforts worked and they were happy to bring positive social change to society.",

      "Sohan was a Forest Ranger in Dehradun. One day he received a call that due to heavy rain there was a huge water flow in the mountain which is heading towards the village at the foothill which will destroy the crops of the villagers. Sohan immediately rushed to the spot with his men and alerted the villagers about it. He with help of his men and other villagers made deep trenches in the ground to divert the direction of the water and they were successful in doing so and they were able to prevent the crops from destroying. Sohan knew that this was a temporary solution and wrote a report to the district administration about the issue and sought a permanent solution for this. Soon authorities built a water reservoir there to prevent water from overflowing into the village and villagers were happy to know that their crops are safe now.  ",

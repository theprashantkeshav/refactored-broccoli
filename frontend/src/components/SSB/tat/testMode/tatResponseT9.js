      "Shyam was a police constable, one day he received a report that the people of a nearby village are burning crop residue in a very large amount after harvesting which is causing serious smoke pollution in nearby towns. Shyam without wasting any time prepared a team and directed them to head towards the village and check out the situation and stop any such activities right away.

He also managed to set up a panchayat meeting where he discussed the bad effects of burning the residue on the environment and how it is causing the problem in nearby towns.

      "Mr. Hari was a teacher in the city convent school. One day while teaching he observed that a student named Akash was standing outside his class. He went to him and asked the reason, the boy told him that he was not able to pay the fees for the last 3 months due to some financial problem and he was not allowed to sit in the classroom for the same. Mr. Hari calmed the student and took him into the class and asked him not to worry about the fees and focus on his studies. After school Mr. Hari went to the school management and told them that Akash is a brilliant student and that due to a financial problem they’re not able to pay the fees, he convinced the management that Akash if given a chance will bring glory to the school so he should be given concession. Upon Mr. Hari’s arguments, the school withdrew the notice and also told the parents that his fees are waived off considering his academic performance. Akash was very happy and worked even harder.",

      "Ajay was a Doctor by profession. One day when he was observing the Blood test reports of his son he observed that Serum creatinine levels were exceptionally high. He knew that serum creatinine levels should not be this high at this stage, so he performed the same test from another laboratory where he was given normal reports, this alarmed Ajay that the former laboratory is giving the wrong diagnosis to patients. A lot of people can suffer due to this. So he immediately approached the laboratory and talked with the pathologist about the same, to prove his point he showed the blood report of his son done in another 2 laboratories. The pathologist immediately apologized and ensured adequate action for the same, he requested the Lab manager and the pathologist to thoroughly calibrate their instruments and regularly check for the accuracy of the results, as any wrong diagnosis can be dangerous to the already suffering patient's health. To ensure that the lab is not compromising with public health Ajay informed the district health officials as well.",

      "Kavita’s son was going through his teenage years due to which she noticed a lot of changes in him, both positive and negative. He got short-tempered and was irritated easily, didn’t listen to anyone, and started behaving strangely. Rather than scolding him, Kavita spent more time and listened to him intently. She also told him about the changes that he is going to experience, both mentally and physically, and assured him that they are always there for him. Along with her husband and elder daughter, she made sure that he never felt alone or disconnected from them and asked him to share anything that comes to his mind with them. This positive environment created by her had a very positive outcome on his son’s life and he was able to sail through his teenage comfortably.",

      "During the COVID pandemic, Parul’s company had laid her off due to shortage of resources and revenues. She was hit hard by the news of being unemployed as she was working there for the last 5 years as a distinguished employee. She didn’t take the news quite well and seldom did she do anything in the house for a few weeks. Due to a shortage of jobs, she was not getting into any company. After talking to friends and family, she got calm and started to see it as an opportunity in disguise. Since she was exceptionally well with coding and designing, she registered herself on freelance.com and made her profile, mentioning her work experience. She was able to get a couple of small projects initially, but as time passed by, she got more responses from people who liked her work. She earned a decent amount and continued it part-time after the covid situation got normal and she got a job. She thanked her friends and family for being there in difficult times.",

      "Mahua, a housewife lived in Koinpur village in Odisha with her family. The village was far away from city life, thus it was quite underdeveloped in terms of water infrastructure. People, including Mahua, had to walk far away to fetch water for daily needs. While talking to her son, who was studying in the city, she got the idea of a self-help group. The next day, while going to fetch water, she pitched the idea and invited women to her house. She served them with cha and nimki and discussed forming a self-help group to address their problems. More and more women joined the SHG and it became quite a strong body among the village, Mahua led and put forward their problems during Panchayat meetings and demanded necessary actions. Due to NABARD schemes, banks also started loaning them money, which they used as helping and lending to the ones in need. Soon, with the disposable money, they were able to set up a small motor and pipe system to help transport water to the village center which was easily accessible than far away wells. ",

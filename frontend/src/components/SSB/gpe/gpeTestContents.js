While you were planning to return to your college for Inter College Musical Night scheduled at 7:30 PM, one forest guard approached your group for help. You observed that he was bleeding and limping badly. On inquiry, he informed that he was beaten by a group of dacoits, who were planning to steal the precious idol from Siva temple around 4 PM and hand it over to smugglers hiding in Kasori Forest Reserve. The guard also informed that another group had decided to loot the passenger train between Dagri and Kanwal near the Kasori Forest Reserve rail bridge on Betwa river. The Dagri - Kanwal passenger train crosses the Betwa Bridge at about 4:30 PM. As you were contemplating you observed that a young couple who had also come for the picnic was shouting for assistance. You turned and saw that the boat in which the young couple was sitting was drowning and they were desperately screaming for help. You were still in shock and trying to keep your cool when a fisherman came running for help as his boat had broken and was drifting in the Kali lake. The time now is 3 PM. You as a group of dynamic young students, how will you handle the situation?",

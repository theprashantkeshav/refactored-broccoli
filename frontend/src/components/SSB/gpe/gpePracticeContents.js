When you reached road junction, a few villagers with an injured person in a bullock cart stopped you and asked for help. The man who had been attacked by a Shark told you the incident. “I had been to the lighthouse Island for fishing and I overheard two smugglers discussing that a consignment of drugs was to reach the Island in a helicopter at 1100 hrs today. To divert the attention of the Coastal guard, they were planning to explode a bomb at the village school at 1130 hrs, where the coastal guard commander would be inaugurating the school’s annual function. When they found out that I was listening, they tried to attack me, and I jumped into the sea and swam towards the shore. Unfortunately, a shark attacked me”. At that time the NCO in charge tells you that he had forgotten to bring the targets for firing. The villagers further informed you that, the culvert had collapsed after they had passed through. Now time is 0930 hrs. As a group of brave young men, what will you do?",

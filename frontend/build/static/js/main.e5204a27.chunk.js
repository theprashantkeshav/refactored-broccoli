He applied, made a CV, gave an interview, and got selected. He was posted to Koinpur village in Orissa on the Social Entrepreneurship project. He went there and got settled in the accommodation provided to him. The village people made organic soap on a small scale and sold them in nearby cities. He went to the village and met everyone. He was unable to understand or communicate with them, so he took help from his colleague who joined 3 months ago. Along with his team, he then learned all the processes of soap making, helped villagers with raw materials and the manufacturing process and used to spend time talking and teaching the village people about entrepreneurship and how they can scale up their businesses. He and his teammates sent pictures, videos, and reports to seniors who published them on YFI\u2019s Instagram page which attracted visitors and investors. He pitched the idea to the investor and was successful in persuading him to invest. This helped scale up operations and generated decent income for the people of the village.
